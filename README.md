Learning GitHub
My name is Michael and I am a budding entrepreneur with the intentions to use some of my profits to help save corals, sharks and the ocean in general. I'm learning how to make a website because I currently don't have the funds to hire someone to do it for me and quite frankly, I enjoy it!
